# The Molecule Machine

The Molecule Machine is an interactive Streamlit application designed to explore concepts in chemistry and molecular science. It provides modules for:

*   **Atomic Viewer:** Visualizing atoms and their properties.
*   **Periodic Table:** Exploring the periodic table of elements.
*   **Reaction Simulator:** Simulating chemical reactions.
*   **Math Workbench:** Tools for performing calculations relevant to chemistry.
*   **Lessons:** Educational content.

## Getting Started

To run this application, you will need Python and Streamlit installed.  It is also recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

1.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (venv):**

    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
    # or
    .venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements
    ```

3.  **Run the app:**

    ```bash
    streamlit run the_molecule_machine/app.py
    ```

    This will open the application in your web browser.
